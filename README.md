# Project Title 
Querying Chinook Digital Music Store Database for Tailored Analysis  

# My Role
Business Intelligence Analyst 

# Project Overview
In this project i will be quering the Chinook Databae which is a SQLlite Database that holds information or data about a music store. For this project, i will be leveraging data-driven tactics to assist the Chinook team to handle complexity  and business challenges or hidden potential business opportunity. In order to achieve this, Chinook Music Store have recently consulted me as a Business Intellligence Analyst to help make sense of their data to see how I can use my skills to reveal important insights buried within.  

As a Business Intelligence Analyst in this project my role is to perform thorough analysis to assist the chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers, employees, and their invoice information. This has been achieved through the use of my Analytical skills, hoping to derive comprehensive insights that will guide both the operational and overall improvement, helping Chinook Store to continue to maintain customer retention through adequate and appropriate customer service satisfaction.

# Problem Statement
The Chinook Music Store lacked visibility into customer purchasing behavior, genre and media format preferences, and artist profitability across regions. Additionally, there was no structured, analyst-friendly SQL environment to support efficient querying, data extraction, and export for deeper analysis.
Key business problems included:  
- Difficulty identifying top-performing customers and their geographic distribution
- Limited insight into popular genres, media types, and artist revenue performance
- Lack of a centralized and user-friendly SQL workspace for analysts
- No defined process for exporting query outputs and transforming them into business insights
- Inefficient communication of findings to stakeholders in a visual and actionable format  

This project addresses these challenges by:  

- Establishing a local SQLite environment using DB Browser for SQLite to execute and export SQL queries
- Writing tailored SQL scripts to answer key business questions
- Exporting cleaned query results to CSV format for structured analysis
- Building a PowerPoint presentation to communicate insights clearly and persuasively to stakeholders

# Stakeholder Engagement
