# My Role

# Project Overview
In this project i will be quering the Chinook Databae which is a SQLlite Database that holds information or data about a music store. For this project, i will be leveraging data-driven tactics to assist the Chinook team to handle complexity  and business challenges or hidden potential business opportunity. In order to achieve this, Chinook Music Store have recently consulted me as a Business Intellligence Analyst to help make sense of their data to see how I can use my skills to reveal important insights buried within.  

As a Business Intelligence Analyst in this project my role is to perform thorough analysis to assist the chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers, employees, and their invoice information. This has been achieved through the use of my Analytical skills, hoping to derive comprehensive insights that will guide both the operational and overall improvement, helping Chinook Store to continue to maintain customer retention through adequate and appropriate customer service satisfaction.
